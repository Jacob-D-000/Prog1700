My entre has been dedicated to learning and growing my academic knowledge. Even as early as middle school I can remember trying to understand math way above my grade level and reading as many books as I could about space. Despite my goals coming  down to earth as an adult, my pursuit of knowledge as only grown. Before coming to COGS, I inital study chemistry as Acadia university. I was ecited to move out on my own, learn what I wanted to learn and be my own person.
